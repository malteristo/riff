# Firebase to Supabase Migration Report

## Overview

This document provides a summary of the migration from Firebase to Supabase for data storage and file storage in the Excalidraw project.

## Migration Status

✅ **COMPLETE**

All Firebase functionality has been successfully migrated to Supabase. Both database and storage operations are now working correctly.

## Components Migrated

1. **Database Operations**
   - Scene storage and retrieval
   - Encrypted data handling
   - Version tracking

2. **Storage Operations**
   - File uploads
   - File downloads
   - Storage permissions

3. **Code Refactoring**
   - Updated imports
   - Renamed constants
   - Enhanced error handling

## Test Results

We've verified the Supabase integration with comprehensive tests:

1. **Database Tests**: ✅ PASSED
   - Create: Successfully creating new scenes
   - Read: Successfully retrieving scenes
   - Update: Successfully updating scenes
   - Delete: Successfully deleting scenes

2. **Storage Tests**: ✅ PASSED
   - Upload: Successfully uploading files to the storage bucket
   - List: Successfully listing files in the storage bucket
   - Download: Successfully downloading files from the storage bucket
   - Delete: Successfully deleting files from the storage bucket

## Implementation Details

### Key Files Updated

- `excalidraw-app/data/supabase.ts`: Supabase client configuration and API implementations
- `excalidraw-app/app_constants.ts`: Updated storage prefix constants to be more generic
- `excalidraw-app/components/ExportToExcalidrawPlus.tsx`: Updated to use Supabase for exports
- `excalidraw-app/data/index.ts`: Updated imports and references to use Supabase
- `excalidraw-app/collab/Collab.tsx`: Updated collaboration features to use Supabase

### Database Schema

The Supabase database uses the following schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE scenes (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  scene_version INTEGER NOT NULL,
  iv INTEGER[] NOT NULL,
  ciphertext INTEGER[] NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL
);
```

### Storage Configuration

The Supabase storage is configured with:

- Bucket name: `riff-files`
- Public access enabled
- RLS policies for read/write access

## Security Considerations

1. **Data Encryption**
   - All scene data is encrypted client-side before storage
   - Encryption keys are not stored in Supabase

2. **Access Controls**
   - Row-level security policies control access to both database and storage
   - Public access is enabled for required resources

## Performance Improvements

The migration to Supabase offers several performance benefits:

1. **PostgreSQL Database**
   - More powerful query capabilities
   - Better scalability

2. **Storage**
   - Direct API access to files
   - Reduced latency

## Known Limitations

1. **Backward Compatibility**
   - The Firebase API methods are still available but redirected to Supabase
   - Full removal of Firebase dependencies may require additional testing

## Recommendations for Future Work

1. **Complete Firebase Removal**
   - Remove `firebase.ts` file entirely
   - Remove Firebase SDK dependencies from `package.json`

2. **Enhanced Monitoring**
   - Add Supabase monitoring and logging
   - Setup alerts for storage/database usage

3. **Optimize Storage**
   - Implement CDN for frequently accessed files
   - Add file expiration policies

## Conclusion

The migration to Supabase has been successfully completed. All functionality that previously relied on Firebase now works with Supabase, and comprehensive tests confirm the migration's success.
